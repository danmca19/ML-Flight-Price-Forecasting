## 2. Models Evaluated
| Model | Description | Type |
|--------|-------------|------|
| **Lasso Regression** | Linear model with L1 regularization | Linear |
| **Random Forest Regressor** | Ensemble of independent trees | Ensemble |
| **Gradient Boosting Regressor** | Sequential boosting of decision trees | Ensemble |

##  3. Cross-Validation Results
| Model | CV RMSE | Train RMSE | R¬≤ | Time (s) |
|--------|----------|-------------|------|-----------|
| ü•á **Random Forest** | **4,338.28** | 4,307.63 | **0.96** | 16.9 |
| Gradient Boosting | 5,201.96 | 5,197.41 | 0.95 | 37.7 |
| Lasso | 6,756.54 | 6,755.14 | 0.91 | 22.9 |

‚úÖ **Random Forest** achieved the best balance between accuracy and generalization.

##  4. Best Model Summary
**Model:** Random Forest Regressor  
**Cross-validation RMSE:** 4,338.28  
**Test RMSE:** 4,365.10  
**R¬≤:** 0.963  

‚û°Ô∏è The model generalizes well and accurately captures pricing behavior across routes and classes.

##  5. Business Interpretation

| Metric | Value | Business Insight |
|---------|--------|-----------------|
| **RMSE** | R$ 4,365.10 | Average error of R$4.4K, consistent in a volatile market. |
| **MAE** | R$ 2,433.30 | On average, prices deviate by ~R$2.4K. |
| **MAPE** | 16.66% | Predictions are within ¬±16.6% of actual price. |
| **Median Abs. Error** | R$ 1,105.69 | Half the errors are below R$1.1K. |
| **RMSE / Avg. Price** | 20.9% | Acceptable for initial pricing estimation. |
| **Accuracy ¬±10%** | 44.98% | Nearly half of predictions fall within 10% margin. |

###  Price Volatility Context
Airfare prices are highly variable, especially across airline type and class:

- **Low-cost airlines:** average R$800‚ÄìR$1,500 ‚Üí RMSE ‚âà R$4K is **too high** (can double real price).  
- **Standard/international carriers:** average R$4K‚ÄìR$10K ‚Üí RMSE ‚âà R$4K equals a **20% deviation**, acceptable for forecasting.  
- **Premium carriers (e.g., Vistara, Air India):** tickets up to R$100K ‚Üí RMSE ‚âà R$4K is **<5% error**, an **excellent precision** in this segment.

‚úàÔ∏è The **ticket class** and **airline** are the biggest sources of volatility, with Business class showing higher but more predictable prices.

##  6. Feature Importance
        
| Feature | Importance | Interpretation |
|----------|-------------|----------------|
| `class_Business` | 0.46 | Ticket class is the top price driver. |
| `class_Economy` | 0.40 | Reinforces the influence of travel class. |
| `duration` | 0.12 | Longer flights ‚Üí higher fares. |
| `days_left` | 0.03 | Shorter booking windows ‚Üí higher prices. |
| `airline_Vistara` | 0.01 | Premium airline effect. |
| `source_city_Delhi` | 0.01 | Slight geographic influence. |

##  7. Strategic Insights
###  Model Enhancements
1. Add **temporal features** (`month`, `season`, `holiday`).
2. Test **XGBoost**, **LightGBM**, and **CatBoost**.
3. Apply **Bayesian optimization** (Optuna, skopt) for tuning.

### Business Opportunities
1. **Customer segmentation:** detect last-minute buyers for targeted offers.  
2. **Up-selling:** pricing sensitivity by class reveals upgrade potential.  
3. **Revenue forecasting:** simulate price and demand scenarios.  
4. **Dynamic pricing:** adjust fares in near real time.  
5. **Route optimization:** identify underpriced or overpriced routes.

##  8. Return on Investment (ROI)

The **ROI analysis** evaluates the business value generated by the predictive model compared to its development and maintenance costs.

### üìò Formula

ROI = ((Total_Benefit - Total_Cost) / Total_Cost) * 100

- **Total_Benefit:** Savings and efficiency gains.  
- **Total_Cost:** Development, deployment, and infrastructure expenses.  

> **Positive ROI (>0%)** ‚Üí the model adds financial value.

###  Example Scenario
| Component | Description | Value (USD) |
|------------|--------------|--------------|
| Cost Reduction | Savings from improved accuracy | 85,000 |
| Operational Efficiency | Time saved through automation | 25,000 |
| **Total Benefit** | ‚Äî | **110,000** |
| Model Development | Data processing, training | 35,000 |
| Deployment & Maintenance | Cloud and monitoring | 15,000 |
| **Total Cost** | ‚Äî | **50,000** |

**ROI = ((110,000 - 50,000) / 50,000) √ó 100 = 120%**

‚úÖ For every **$1 invested**, the model returns **$2.20 in value**.

##  9. Conclusion
The **Random Forest model** delivers **high accuracy (R¬≤ ‚âà 0.96)** and strong generalization.  
It is suitable for **pricing strategy support**, **competitive benchmarking**, and **ROI-driven decision-making** in dynamic airline markets.
